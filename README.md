## 🤖 Project 1: AI-Powered Voicemail Triage System (New Caller)
 
### Problem
Incoming voicemails were being handled manually — someone had to listen, decide what to do, and create a task. This was slow and inconsistent.
 
### What I Built
An automated pipeline that receives voicemails, analyzes them with AI, and creates tasks automatically — with no human needed in the middle.
 
### How It Works
1. **Trigger** — A new voicemail is received via phone system
2. **Format** — Raw voicemail data is cleaned and structured
3. **Filter** — Only relevant voicemails pass through (spam/irrelevant calls are dropped)
4. **Memory check** — System checks if this caller has contacted before
5. **AI Analysis** — AI reads the voicemail content and extracts key information
6. **Task Creation** — A new task is automatically created in the project management tool with AI-generated summary
7. **Memory update** — Caller is stored so future calls are recognized
### Tools Used
`RingCentral` `Zapier` `AI by Zapier` `ClickUp` `Storage by Zapier`
 
### Impact
- Eliminated manual voicemail review
- Consistent task creation with AI-generated summaries
- Zero missed follow-ups

## 🔁 Project 2: AI-Powered Voicemail Triage System (Returning Caller)
 
### Problem
Returning callers were being treated the same as new ones — creating duplicate tasks and losing conversation history.
 
### What I Built
An extension of Project 1 that intelligently identifies returning callers and adds updates to existing tasks instead of creating duplicates.
 
### How It Works
1. **Trigger** — A processed call recording is received
2. **Format** — Data is structured for processing
3. **Filter** — Irrelevant recordings are excluded
4. **Memory check** — System identifies this as a returning caller
5. **Route** — Instead of creating a new task, a comment is added to the existing task
6. **Update** — Task history stays clean and connected
### Tools Used
`RingCentral` `Zapier` `ClickUp` `Storage by Zapier`
 
### Impact
- No duplicate tasks for returning callers
- Full conversation history in one place
- Cleaner project management workflow

## 📧 Project 3: Gmail to Task Automation with AI Triage
 
### Problem
Important emails were being missed or manually converted into tasks — a slow, inconsistent process that depended on someone remembering to do it.
 
### What I Built
An automation that monitors a labeled Gmail inbox, uses AI to analyze each email, and automatically creates a structured task in the project management tool.
 
### How It Works
1. **Trigger** — A new email arrives with a specific Gmail label
2. **AI Analysis** — AI reads the email and extracts relevant data (priority, action needed, key details)
3. **Task Creation** — A structured task is created automatically in ClickUp with AI-generated content
### Tools Used
`Gmail` `AI by Zapier` `ClickUp`
 
### Impact
- No emails fall through the cracks
- Tasks created instantly with AI-generated summaries
- Reduced manual data entry
